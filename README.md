# 0 - 100 Real Quick (Python Problems)

Today, 2015 August 21st, I am going to embark on a journey of completing 100 python problems. Ranging from increasing complexities from 1-3.

### Complexity Scale:

Easy | Medium | Hard
--- | --- | ---
1 | 2 | 3

```python
python = 'is going to be the language of choice'

def anti_vowel(text):
	text = text.lower()
	vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u']
	return ''.join([x for x in text if x not in vowels])

anti_vowel(python)
Output: 's gng t b th lngg f chc'
```

You are welcome to work on these with me and send request pull your solutions! I promise I won't look at your solutions haha. Only for cross-checking once I complete my solution. Perhaps this repository might be of use to other learners who can see multiple solutions to a problem.

<em>In any case...</em>
