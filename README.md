# Read to 100 Problems

Today, 2015 August 21st, I am going to embark on a journey of completing 100 python problems. Ranging from increasing complexities from 1-3.

### Complexity Scale:

Easy | Medium | Hard
--- | --- | ---
1 | 2 | 3

```python
python = 'is going to be the language of choice'

def anti_vowel(text):
	text = text.lower()
	vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u']
	return ''.join([x for x in text if x not in vowels])

anti_vowel(python)
Output: 's gng t b th lngg f chc'
```

####So, sit back and enjoy the ride...
